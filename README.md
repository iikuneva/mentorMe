MentorME APP

Idea

MentorME app connects people who want to learn and share knowledges and experience.
If you are registered user you will be able to create your own profile like CV, where you must choose a role -  mentor or mentee.
If your role is a mentee you can choose your mentor and send him/her an invitation.
In case you are the mentor - you can accept or reject the invitation.
Both mentor and mentee could follow their connections in mentorship page.
